This blog is a evolving Digital Garden on my thoughts on Personal Finance, Practical Philosophy, DIY, Engineering and Travelling

This also helps me in clear thinking as writing is a powerful tool to understand what's going on in your mind and declutter your thoughts

I would use [[Obsidian]](https://obsidian.md/) to interlink the notes and create a visual graph for my thinking on various topics. All the posts in this blog are first written in Obsidian and then pushed to Github which would be rendered as website by [[Jekyll ]](https://jekyll-garden.github.io/posts/how-to) 

Starting with below topics

- [[Books and Articles]]
	- Few books I read and number of aritcles that I read
- [[Personal Finance]]
- Cooking
	- All the foods I know and their recipes
- [[DIYs]]
- Life Hacks
- Softwares that I use
- [[Creativity]]
