[Justin Guitar](https://www.justinguitar.com) is where I am learning Guitar from. This is part of the habits I picked up after completing the book Atomic habits. I will soon find a way to include the tracker on this Digital Garden for the habits I am tracking on my phone now.

Currently I learnt Chrod D and A and strumming on the 1.

Module 1 Practice
3 min chord D perfection
3 min chord A perfection
2 min anchor finger, just changing chords but not strumming
2X 1 min chord change strumming and note down changes 
10 min song practice

Record the progress in a video
