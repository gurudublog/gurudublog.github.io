I agree that was a clickbait title, but this page is about how i am changing my desk to a standing desk with minimal changes and how anyone can make it during this work from home time without spending much money

I have a [IKEA desk] that i am currently using along with a chair. I always wanted a standing desk the way I used to have in my office but that comes with a considerably high cost. I was about to spend on it but realized there is a cheaper and easier way to do it

Below was my setup previously (I wish I had a picture that shows the floor too)
