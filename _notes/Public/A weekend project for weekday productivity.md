I agree that was a clickbait title, but this page is about how i am changing my normal desk to a standing desk with minimal changes and how anyone can make it during this work from home time without spending much money.

I have a [IKEA Tarendo](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/taerendoe-table-black-s99000483/) desk that i am currently using along with a chair. I always wanted a standing desk the way I used to have in my office but that comes with a considerably high cost. I was about to spend on it but realized there is a cheaper and easier way to do it

Below was my setup previously (I wish I had a picture that shows the floor too)

This desk has 3cmx3cm legs. The idea is to raise the height of the desk to a standing desk and use a bar top chair to raise the sitting height as well. This way the default mode of desk is standing desk which I want to do most of the time during work and whenever i feel like sitting I should use bar top chair

So I need something that can lift up these 3x3 cm legs. A hallow 4X4 cm pipe works for this. I would have to insert the table legs into this hallow pipe and use some sort of support to stop the legs at a desired height

I measured the height I want to raise my table to and got 4 pipes with extra length.

I got holes drilled into the pipe at a point where my legs should rest at.

I then installed bolts at this height so legs can rest and voila and I have a standing desk at just 600 rs.

I should now paint the legs to make it look good and get a [bar top chair](https://www.amazon.in/CHAIRWALE%C2%AE-Adjustable-Comfortable-Reception-MilkyWhite-Black/dp/B08Y937W2L/ref=sr_1_27?crid=1RXA1Z9PE9GB8&keywords=bar+top+chair&qid=1645300899&sprefix=bar+top+cai%2Caps%2C308&sr=8-27)
