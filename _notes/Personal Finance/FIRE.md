I learnt this concept from https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREIndia/

Below is how would I summarize what I learnt about this concept

1. Understand how money works and figure out your definition of “enough”
2. Always be in good paying job or running a business 
3. Enjoy every second of your life because thats what matters at the end. 
4. Review your goals often ( ever half year or an year )
5. When expectations grow faster than your income you would mostly be dissatisfied 
6. While doing all these, you might become numbers person which i think we should try to minimise and focus on broader aspect
