This blog is a evolving Digital Garden on my thoughts on Personal Finance, Practical Philosophy, DIY, Engineering and Travelling

This also helps me in clear thinking as writing is a powerful tool to understand what's going on in your mind and declutter your thoughts

I would use [[Obsidian]](https://obsidian.md/) to interlink the notes and create a visual graph for my thinking on various topics. All the posts in this blog are first written in Obsidian and then pushed to Github which would be rendered by [[Jekyll ]](https://jekyll-garden.github.io/posts/how-to)
