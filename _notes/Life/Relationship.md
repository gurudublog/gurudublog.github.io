I have been reading and understanding about relationships and life partner off late and it first started with a WaitButWhy aritcle [How to Pick Your Life Partner](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/pick-life-partner.html) few years back and kind of figured out what this is all about with Daniel Sloss Netflix Live show called [Jigsaw](https://www.netflix.com/in/title/80223685) (thanks to anonymous redditor who commented about this show and I happen to see this show at 4AM on that day). 


Recently I have met most of my friends after a long time in a friend's marriage and half of the them are married. One of my best friend started asking married people how did you take the decision and what did you discuss before the marriage. While there were many responses and thoughts, I thought I had good knowledge on this and writing is the best form of clearing and understanding your thoughts. So i decided to pen down those thoughts.

Some of the qualities for a good and happy long term relationship I think are below and I will try to describe them 

- Be a huge giver. Both the people in relationship should try to give more and both would be happy. 
	- This might seem controversial but this is how it works in the end. A [good thread](https://twitter.com/shaanvp/status/1429496148297883656)  on this topic. 
	- Lines from Morgan Housel on this

	- This might have a downside of one person taking advantage of other when this is not done right. I think the magnitude of sync between two people solves that problem
- Having a better sync between two people leads to a happier relationship
	- Having a lot of common activities/interests that you both love to do
	- Having common thoughts on life values
- Respect for each other
	- This would be the most important quality. Having respect for each others personality and thoughts ups the game to next level. This can be sometimes deciding factor when things go bleak
	- Understand the person, their past and how their life shaped and you would have a better idea on how to deal with this factor 
- Comparison
	- I think Human brain and eco system is evolved to compare in a fraction of seconds unconsciously 
	- Understand that this is not a game of comparison and grass would always look greener on the side
- Decide what is enoughÂ 
- Live in the moment
	- Getting anxious about future and getting stuck in the past wouldn't help in anyway once you decide what is enough. 
	- There is nothing beautiful than two people living in the moment and experiencing what's coming in every second.
- Be more open and understand that world is constantly changing 
	- You are now exposed to different world views than ever (with online presence). Getting along with people/thoughts that you disagree with would be a huge advantage in these times
- Understand how to prioritise things at hand
- Marriage is a bet
	- Just like a lot of things in life, marriage is a bet. Be ready to accept that it can fail or you would be at a loss. Reason can be anything. 
- Low expectations
	- Have low expectations and find ways to enjoy your time together with the things at hand
- Be honest and genuine 



Some other related things I know/read of

- True success is when the people who you want to love you do love you and that comes overwhelmingly from how you treat people.
